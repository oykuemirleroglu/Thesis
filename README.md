# What is SchedulEasy ?

  SchedulEasy is a web application developed with React.js and TailwindCss. It uses Firabase for backend. The aim of the project, as the name suggests, is to enable easy scheduling of events with more than one participant with a joint decision.

# How does the process work ?

  Users create a new account in the app. They can then create a new event. The creator of the event creates the event after entering the necessary information. Users who are invited to the event vote for the date options that suit them. If they wish, they can add a new date option. Finally, the event creator decides the deadline according to the unanimous vote. After the date of the event is set, no one can vote.

# What you can do ?

- You can add friends to be able to invite them easily to your events.
- You can chat with participants to discuss about details.
- If you are not avaliable any date option you can suggest new one !
